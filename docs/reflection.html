        <h1>Comparitive Essay (PSU site vs Github site)</h1>
        <p>The most significant challenges for a new learner are understanding how each element works.  This has been very difficult for me when trying to move things around my page and style things different ways.  I would constantly have to look things up and I would end up with like 20 tabs open in order to complete my websites.  One advantage with the PSU site is that it is more user friendly, and more starter friendly.  That being said, learning to code with the Github site is going to be more valuable in the long run because HTML coding is far more abundant the the Penn state website maker.  The website maker from Penn State has an advantage if you are planning on making one or maybe two websites throughout your life because it is fairly easy to learn and very user friendly.  Another benefit of the Penn State website is that you can see all of the changes that you are making at the time that you are making them.  It makes it faster to realize that maybe you donâ€™t like something that you coded in.  To modify the layout of the PSU site is fairly straight forward, there are even preset models that you can choose from to assist you in this.  The Github website proved to be more challenging because it was not always straight forward.  Skills necessary to develop the psu site were very minimal, the process is straight forward, individuals need a basic idea on how to code and the attention span to sit down and work on it.  The Github website proved to be more challenging, where individuals need to know some of the coding language of HTML and CSS and how each element interacts with each other.  Skills that I can hopefully grow upon in the future are better learning how to style specific things in on a website and more of the HTML language. Moving forward with this class I choose to continue with the Github website so that I can continue to strengthen my HTML and CSS coding.
