        <h3>About me</h3>
        <section>My name is Jacob Ruffalo. I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Penn State Behrend.  In this website, you will recieve an in-depth look at what my interests are and how they inspire me to pursue a career in Mechanical Engineering.  Firstly, I am hugly interested in cars.  Performance cars have been facinating to me since I was a child and my interest continues to grow and grow.  I love learning how they work and how each component reacts with other components.  Learning about cars is the main reason that I chose engineering; I want to be a part of the design process for future performance cars.  Secondly, I love video games.  I love playing with my friends and having a good time.  Video games and video game consols require large amounts of engineering, further interesting me in engineering fields.  Throughout high school, I played many musical instruments.  Ranging from the clarinet to the trombone to the trumpet to the tuba, I played these instruments to get a feel for how they work.  How the air moving through the instruments reacts mechanically with the buttons and valves pressed down.  Each instrument is different and the reason why each sounds different is due to the physical air flow through them.  This is another example of my interest in engineering.   </section>
