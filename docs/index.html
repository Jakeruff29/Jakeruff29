     <h4>Welcome to my portfolio website!</h4>
        <h3>About me</h3>
        <section>My name is Jacob Ruffalo. I am a Mechanical Engineering student at Penn State Behrend.  In this website, you will recieve an in-depth look at what my interests are and how they inspire me to pursue a career in Mechanical Engineering.  Firstly, I am hugly interested in cars.  Performance cars have been facinating to me since I was a child and my interest continues to grow and grow.  I love learning how they work and how each component reacts with other components.  Learning about cars is the main reason that I chose engineering; I want to be a part of the design process for future performance cars.  Secondly, I love video games.  I love playing with my friends and having a good time.  Video games and video game consols require large amounts of engineering, further interesting me in engineering fields.  Throughout high school, I played many musical instruments.  Ranging from the clarinet to the trombone to the trumpet to the tuba, I played these instruments to get a feel for how they work.  How the air moving through the instruments reacts mechanically with the buttons and valves pressed down.  Each instrument is different and the reason why each sounds different is due to the physical air flow through them.  This is another example of my interest in engineering.   </section>

           <h3>My Digital projects</h3>
           <h4><u>Digit 100</u></h4>
           <section>
               <p>Digit 100 is a digital humanities class offered at Penn State Behrend where individuals learn basics of Html coding and many other important skills.  This is the first class that I have taken along these lines, so my digital work is limited.  During this class, we used Hypothes.is to annotate articles which we read in class, and share these annotations with other students in the class. </p>

        <div class="center"><p>I played many instuments throughout my schooling including the Tuba, bass trombone, trumpet, french horn and the clarinet.  I enjoyed learning how each instrument worked as well as listening to the sound that each produced.  I used my skills on these instruments to volunteer my time to assist the teacher of the elementary school to help younger students learn these instruments.</p></div>
