        <h1>Where the Goats Are Analysis</h1>
        <p>        Where the Goats Are is about a woman named Tikvah who lives on a small farm. The game is
            a meditative type game where there are no major problems to stress out the player, one
            simply accomplishes tasks common on farms. The farm consists of only warm colors in
            order to add to the calming factors that the game supplies. The land on the farm has a
            golden yellow ground, such as sand. The fence and main body of the house have a
            yellowish tint from the land but are otherwise white objects. The hay and trim pieces on
            both the house and chicken coop are yellow as well. The roof of the house and the
            chicken coop contain a mosaic style roof, with various colors such as red, yellow, brown
            and a hint of green. Tikvah’s dress contains a mixture of yellow and green as well. Upon
            beginning the game, the player is more or less thrown into it and there are no
            instructions to get started. Tikvah exits her house with a small selection of objects
            near her and the game begins. It is a game where you learn from playing, and is mostly
            meant to be a calming experience for the player. There does not appear to be any
            challenge to the game, it is simply about developing a daily routine of finishing common
            small farm tasks. </p>
        <p>         Outside the house, there are a variety of items. A basket, a bucket, a small
            can, a potted plant, and a stick. The objects glow when hovered over suggesting that
            they can be interacted with, however that is all you know upon starting. I still haven't
            found the purpose of the stick, other than to draw images in the sand. Throughout the
            game, the goal is to produce cheese. First, the goats need to eat the hay. Once they are
            fed, Tikvah can milk them using the bucket. The full bucket of milk is then dumped into
            a cheese vat that is then heated. After the milk is heated, Tikvah must interact with
            the vat once more and cheese is produced. (One note, if you leave the heated milk in the
            vat overnight, it disappears). The cheese sits on a counter outside until it is used to
            purchase something new. The merchant arrives at Tikvah's house regularly, and stands
            outside of her fence waiting to make a trade. (Another side note, the merchant doesn’t
            hang around long, so you must stop what you're doing in order to interact with him. He
            always seems to conveniently leave as soon as i'm about to talk to him.) </p>
        <p>         Tikvah throughout the game moves slowly signifying that she might be elderly
            (It also means that you need a lot of patients in order to enjoy the game). She receives
            mail that suggests that something bad is happening to the world, and the presence of
            crows and a storm help to solidify that claim. Some further notes on the game that I
            have are that the audio in the game was quite loud, and there was no way to turn it down
            in the game settings. I also noticed that no actions are actually critical. You can
            collect eggs and take them inside to eat them, but you do not need to do that. Also you
            can water the plant, but nothing happens to it if you fail to do so. This being said,
            doing these tasks seem to take away from the overall time of the day in the game, the
            time that you could be spending to make cheese. </p>
           <p>      The goats seem to leave the yard if the gate is left open, but they always
            return at night time. The goats also slide around when they are moving and eating, there
            is no animation for the goat eating and walking. Also, the chickens run away from the
            mouse cursor which is a cool feature, however they do not run away from it at night
            time. One thing that I would add to the game is an instruction booklet in the menu so
            that the player can read about what the objects do, as I still do not know what the
            stick does.</p>

        <p>This image above shows Tikvah in her farm holding the bucket. This is near the middle of the day where the color scheme is all bright, warm colors providing a meditative feeling for the player.  </p>

        <p>The image above shows the evening in Where the Goats are.  The bright colors all around appear darker suggesting that the level of light is getting lower.  Also the merchant can be seen talking to Tikvah.</p>

        <p>The image above shows night time in Where the goats are.  The goats and chickens have all gone inside and the farm is empty except for Tikvah, who is still up making cheese.  The fire from the milk vat can be shown emitting light, which is a cool feature in the game, because most of the gameplay takes place during the day.  </p>
